I am Linda, a Frontend Developer at BuyCoins, you can call me Linda too.
Before getting into programming, I thought it was magic, something you couldn’t just learn. I assumed you had to be extraordinarily smart to speak the ‘language of computers’. Don’t worry if you feel that way.


I studied Biomedical Engineering and graduated in 2017. I spent my service year working at a Federal Medical Centre as a biomedical engineer. During that time, I decided to explore my various interests, one of which is programming.

Six months after rounding up my service, I started my first day as a frontend developer intern at Buycoins in June 2019. I was very excited, it felt surreal. I realized instantly that I had not been learning how to code in the most effective way.

The most popular programmers are web programmers (Frontend and Backend). Most newbies think they have to be one or the other. I suggest you research the various careers in programming and make a decision on what you want to explore.
