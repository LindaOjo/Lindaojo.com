Front-end developers link together the world of design and technology, packaging up the utility of the back end in an inviting way for users to interact with. Doing this requires different skills and to be honest it can get difficult real quick.

Today, I share 4 useful tools and websites that make my work a lot easier on some days.

CSS Grid Layout is a layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, that handles both columns and rows. grid systems can get complicated especially when dealing with multiple boxes of different sizes.

CSS Grid Generator is a great handy tool cause it lets you set up a Grid system for even complex layouts with ease.

Animate.css is a small and easy-to-use CSS animation library. It contains ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for use in your web projects. Animate.css can be installed as a package or a CDN. You could also copy the styles of a specific animate from the website and use them directly in your project.
