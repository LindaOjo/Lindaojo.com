I heard the british use biscuits instead of cookies...weird.

Okay, let's focus.

<h3>What are Cookies</h3>

Cookies, more properly called HTTP cookies, are small bits of data stored as text files on a browser. Cookies associate bits of data to a specific user.

For instance, if you accept cookies from a website, the website may deliver a cookie identifying you as user-A. If you ever visit that website again, that cookie will be used  to recognize that you are the same user-A that was at the website at a previous time.

Cookies could then be used to make the user-A's experience on the website fast and personalized. For example, user-A's preferences such as language and preferred theme could be save for future sessions.

<h3>Types of Cookies</h3>

<h4>Session cookies</h4>

Session cookies, also known as 'temporary cookies', help websites recognise users and the information provided when they navigate through a website. Session cookies only retain information about a user's activities for as long as they are on the website. Once the web browser is closed, the cookies are deleted.

<h4>Permanent cookies</h4>

Permanent cookies are also known as 'persistent cookies'. They remain in operation even after the web browser has closed. For example they can remember login details and passwords so web users don't need to re-enter them every time they use a site.

<h4>Third-party cookies</h4>

Third-party cookies are installed by third-parties with the aim of collecting certain information from web users to carry out research into, for example, behaviour, demographics or spending habits. They are commonly used by advertisers who want to ensure that products and services are marketed towards the right target audience.

<h4>Flash cookies</h4>

Flash cookies are also known as 'super cookies'. They are independent from the web browser. They are designed to be permanently stored on a user's computer. These types of cookies remain on a user's device even after all cookies have been deleted from their web browser.

<h4>Zombie cookies</h4>

Zombie cookies are a type of flash cookie that are automatically re-created after a user has deleted them. This means they are difficult to detect or manage. They are often used in online games to prevent users from cheating, but have also been used to install malicious software onto a user's device.

<h4>Secure Cookies</h4>

Only HTTPS websites can set secure cookies, i.e., cookies with encrypted data. Mostly, the checkout or payment pages of e-commerce websites have secure cookies to facilitate safer transactions. Similarly, online banking websites are required to use secure cookies for security reasons.
